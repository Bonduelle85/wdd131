            Defense of the Ancients (DotA) began its history as a user-created
            map for the game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion The
            Frozen Throne. This map was created by fans and quickly gained
            popularity due to its unique gameplay and strategic approach. In
            2009, Valve decided to develop their own version of the game called
            Dota 2. After several years of development and testing, Dota 2 was
            released in 2013 and immediately captured the hearts of millions of
            players worldwide. Today, Dota 2 remains one of the most popular and
            recognized games in the MOBA genre.

            Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where two
            teams of five players each compete to destroy the enemy team's
            Ancient while defending their own. Players select from a roster of
            heroes with unique abilities and roles. The game is played on a map
            with three lanes, each guarded by defensive towers. Players earn
            gold and experience by defeating enemy units and structures to level
            up and purchase items to strengthen their heroes. Communication and
            teamwork are essential to success, as players must coordinate
            strategies, control map objectives, and outmaneuver their opponents
            to achieve victory. The team that destroys the enemy Ancient first
            wins the game.
